\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

Our research in this work investigates the interactions between population size, adaptive potential, and population structure in influencing selection on hypermutator traits within asexual populations.
In our first experiments, we replicate previous work by \citet{raynes2018sign} showing sign-change effects of population size on hypermutator favorability
Subsequent experiments investigate how these dynamics change when limited beneficial mutations are available, and sensitivity to initial abundance of hypermutators in the population.
Finally, experiments survey behavior across three regimes of population spatial structure.
We find that the sign effect of population size on hypermutator favorability is dependent on spatial structure.

\subsection{Scaling Population Size}
\label{sec:scaling-population-size}

In a first set of experiments, we tested how hypermutator fixation probability varies with changes in population size.

Previous work by \citet{raynes2018sign} has demonstrated that hypermutator dynamics can transition through several regimes with population scale.
In the first regime, when population size is very small, hypermutator fixation is nearly equiprobable with normomutator fixation, owing to the overwhelming influence of stochastic effects.
Subsequently, in medium-sized populations, become disfavored by selection.
Intuitively, this can be attributed to the power of selection becoming sufficiently sensitive to penalize the mutational load imposed by hypermutator traits.
However, in sufficiently lare populations, hypermutator fixation can move towards certainty.
This is because, in asexual populations, hypermutator alleles that discover a significant beneficial mutation can gain in population share by association with that beneficial allele.
Population size increases the probability of at least one hypermutator discovering a beneficial mutation, and so ``hitch-hiking'' to sweep out normomutators.

As shown in the left column of Figure \ref{fig:wse-inf-one:32}, we also find a sign-change phenomenon with population scale, as previously reported by \citet{raynes2018sign}.
By applying the WSE hardware accelerator, we were able to test population sizes orders of magnitude beyond the previous upper ceiling of 10,000 agents --- up to 1.5 billion agents.
However, we do not see any qualitative difference emerge between large and very large population sizes, with respect to hypermutator fixation probability.
With the largest-tested population count per deme, shown as the left column of Figure \ref{fig:wse-inf-one:2048}, resolution of our population size sweep becomes too coarse-grained to show the original sign-change phenomenon through small and medium-sized populations, but hypermutators retain strong selective favor across large and very large population sizes.

We found this to be consistent across both the Poisson model and the site-explicit model.

Notably, this result is a different story than was found by \citet{raynes2019migration} when studying effect of spatial structure on hypermutatoe prevalence.

\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

Our investigation in this work focuses on the interactions between population size, adaptive potential, and population structure in influencing selection on hypermutator traits within asexual populations.
In our first experiments, we replicate previous work by \citet{raynes2018sign} showing sign-change effects of population size on hypermutator favorability
Subsequent experiments investigate how these dynamics change when limited beneficial mutations are available, and sensitivity to initial abundance of hypermutators in the population.
Finally, experiments survey behavior across three regimes of population spatial structure.
We find that the sign effect of population size on hypermutator favorability is dependent on spatial structure.

\subsection{Sign-change Effects of Population Size}

Our first set of experiments sought to investigate how acted in larger populations than had been tested in original experiments
Previous work by \citet{raynes2018sign} has shown that as population size scales, selection on hypermutators can move through several regimes.
It starts out as neutral when population size is very small, owing to the power of stochastic effects.
As population size increases, hypermutators first become disfavored by selection.
Intuitively, this can be imagined as the population size becoming large enough to select against the mutation load imposed by hypermutator traits.
However, as population size increases even further, hypermutators can become favored.
This is because in large enough populations, the chance that at least one hypermutator will discover a beneficial mutation that allows it to sweep to fixation becomes a good chance.

With larger population count per PE, resolution of our population size sweep becomes too coarse grained to reflect this effect at small population sizes.

\subsection{Normomutators are Consistently More Resilient when Background Hypermutator Prevalence is Low}

We found this to be consistent across both the Poisson model and the site-explicit model.

\subsection{Population Structure determines the sign effect of population size}

Notably, this result is a different story than was found by \citet{raynes2019migration} when studying effect of spatial structure on hypermutatoe prevalence.

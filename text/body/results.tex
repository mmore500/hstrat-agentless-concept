\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

Our research in this work investigates the interactions between population size, adaptive potential, and population structure in influencing selection on hypermutator traits within asexual populations.
In our first experiments, we replicate previous work by \citet{raynes2018sign} showing sign-change effects of population size on hypermutator favorability
Subsequent experiments investigate how these dynamics change when limited beneficial mutations are available, and sensitivity to initial abundance of hypermutators in the population.
Finally, experiments survey behavior across three regimes of population spatial structure.
We find that the sign effect of population size on hypermutator favorability is dependent on spatial structure.

\subsection{Scaling Population Size}
\label{sec:scaling-population-size}

In a first set of experiments, we tested how hypermutator fixation probability varies with changes in population size.

Previous work by \citet{raynes2018sign} has demonstrated that hypermutator dynamics can transition through several regimes with population scale.
In the first regime, when population size is very small, hypermutator fixation is nearly equiprobable with normomutator fixation, owing to the overwhelming influence of stochastic effects.
Subsequently, in medium-sized populations, become disfavored by selection.
Intuitively, this can be attributed to the power of selection becoming sufficiently sensitive to penalize the mutational load imposed by hypermutator traits.
However, in sufficiently lare populations, hypermutator fixation can move towards certainty.
This is because, in asexual populations, hypermutator alleles that discover a significant beneficial mutation can gain in population share by association with that beneficial allele.
Population size increases the probability of at least one hypermutator discovering a beneficial mutation, and so ``hitch-hiking'' to sweep out normomutators.

\input{fig/wse-inf-one}

As shown in the left column of Figure \ref{fig:wse-inf-one:32}, we also find a sign-change phenomenon with population scale, as previously reported by \citet{raynes2018sign}.
By applying the WSE hardware accelerator, we were able to test population sizes orders of magnitude beyond the previous upper ceiling of 10,000 agents --- up to 1.5 billion agents.
However, we do not see any qualitative difference emerge between large and very large population sizes, with respect to hypermutator fixation probability.
With the largest-tested population count per deme, shown as the left column of Figure \ref{fig:wse-inf-one:2048}, resolution of our population size sweep becomes too coarse-grained to show the original sign-change phenomenon through small and medium-sized populations, but hypermutators retain strong selective favor across large and very large population sizes.

\subsection{Restricting Adaptive Potential}
\label{sec:restricting-adaptive-potential}

Prediction of a strong tendency for hypermutator fixation in large populations prompts a converse question: what conditions would be necessary for large populations to resist hypermutator invasion?
One assumption of the above result is availability of abundant potential beneficial mutations.
Indeed, agent-based modeling work has largely yet to explore scenarios where few beneficial mutations are available \citep{raynes2013effect,raynes2018sign,raynes2019selection,raynes2019migration}.
Recent empirical work, however, has shown indications that fitness landscape characteristics can play can a role in influencing hypermutator favorability.

To investigate this question, we next performed experiments where the supply of possible beneficial mutations was constrained.
The right panels of Figures \cleveref{fig:wse-inf-one:32,fig:wse-inf-one:2048} show hypermutator fixation probabilities where agents could accrue no more than one beneficial mutation.
At both 32- and 2,048 agents per deme, and additional, third regime of selection on hypermutator traits appears past population sizes of 1 million agents.
Beyond this point, normomutators reliably drive hypermutators to extinction.
We expect this effect to be associated with sufficient scale that at least one normomutator reliably discovers the beneficial mutation before the hypermutator trait fixes.
Then, given the large population size, selection should reliably advantages normomutators' reduced deleterious mutation load.

\input{fig/avail-ben-muts}

Next, we tested the sensitivity of normomutator persistence in large populations to the amount of adaptive potential available.
Figure \ref{fig:avail-ben-muts} shows fixation curves where one, two, three, four, and five beneficial mutations are available, conducted with 256 agents per deme.
Under surveyed conditions, with 2D spatial structure and hypermutators begining in equal proportion to normomutators, resilience to hypermutator fixation is very fragile.
Normomutator persistence rapidly decays with increases in adaptive potential;
even in billion-agent populations, hypermutators begin to regain favor past three beneficial mutations available.

\subsection{Effects of Background Hypermutator Prevalence}
\label{sec:background-hypermutator-prevalence}

\input{fig/denovo-5050-conditions}

We found this to be consistent across both the Poisson model and the site-explicit model.

\subsection{Effects of Population Structure}
\label{sec:population-structure}

\input{fig/spatial-structure}

Notably, this result is a different story than was found by \citet{raynes2019migration} when studying effect of spatial structure on hypermutatoe prevalence.

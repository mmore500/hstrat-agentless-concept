Figure \ref{fig:perf} compares simulation performance between hardware platforms, measured in agent-generations per second (AGPS).
Mean throughput was 7.0 (SD 0.5) million AGPS on CPU, 2.7 (SD 0.03) billion AGPS on GPU, and 780 (SD 0.5) billion on WSE for \textit{de novo} trials using the Poisson model.
Net speedup, normalized to mean CPU throughput, was 378x (SD 4) on GPU and 111,091x (SD 75) on WSE.
Normalized to net GPU performance, WSE provided a speedup of 294x (SD 0.2).

Under the site-explicit model, WSE gave 650 (SD 50) billion AGPS under \textit{de novo} conditions.
The site-explicit model was not implemented on GPU.
For all the above, 50/50 trials gave similar performance to \textit{de novo}.

On WSE, we found agent-generation throughput to be generally consistent across per-PE population densities, as shown in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:perf-tilepop}.
In contrast, mean GPU throughput dropped to 121 million AGPS when increasing net population size from 15.1 million to 175 million.
